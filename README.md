# SIMPLE_TRADEMODELS
This project was initiated on 10/2022 used as my own reference for simple trading models that already exist. The GitHub repository is created on 09/2024 for public use yet not all models have been uploaded. The hub will be updated regulary (hopefully).

### Current Existing Models (in this repository):
1. Moving Average Crossover Strategy
2. Black Swan Model
3. Holt-Winter Forecasting

### Testings & Implementing
All referencing models in this repository are coded in ipython. Ideal this should be run or either python, or even better C++.
The choice of Jupyter Notebook is simply for demonstrating purposes and readability.
