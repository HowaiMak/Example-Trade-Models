# Example-Trade-Models  
**Simple Trading and Forecasting Models**  

## Outline  
This project was initiated in **October 2022** as a personal reference for existing simple trading models. The GitHub repository was created in **September 2024** for public use, though not all models have been uploaded yet. The repository will be updated regularly (hopefully).  

### Current Models in This Repository:  
1. **Moving Average Crossover Strategy**  
2. **Holt-Winters Time Series Forecasting**  
3. **Mean Reversion Strategy**  
4. **Black Swan Event Indicators**  

## Testing & Implementation  
All models in this repository are implemented in **IPython**. Ideally, they should be run in **Python**, or even better, optimized for **C++**.  
The use of **Jupyter Notebook** is primarily for **demonstration and readability**.  

## Cross-Validation & Strategy Stacking  
It is encouraged to **combine multiple strategies** to generate deeper insights for trading decisions. Some of my private strategies also follow this approach.
