# SIMPLE_TRADEMODELS
This project is a repository to store simple models that already exist for references.
Ideally, this will include either trading strategies or forecasting methods.
The hub will be updated regulary (hopefully).

### Current Existing Models (in this repository):
1. Moving Average Crossover Strategy
2. Holt-Winter Forecasting
