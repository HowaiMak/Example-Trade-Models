# SIMPLE_TRADEMODELS
Simple Trading and Forecasting Models
## Outline
This project was initiated on 10/2022 and used as my own reference for simple trading models that already exist. The GitHub repository was created on 09/2024 for public use, yet not all models have been uploaded. The hub will be updated regularly (hopefully).

### Current Existing Models (in this repository):
1. Moving Average Crossover Strategy
2. Holts-Winter Time Series Forecasting
3. Mean Reversion Strategy

## Testings & Implementing:
All referencing models in this repository are coded in ipython. Idealy this should be run or either python, or even better C++.
The choice of Jupyter Notebook is simply for demonstrating purposes and readability.

## Cross Validations:
It is welcomed to use multiple strategy at the same time to generate insights for trading decisions. Some of my private strategies also adapts the same ideology.
