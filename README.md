# SIMPLE_TRADEMODELS
Simple Trading and Forecasting Models
## Outline
This project was initiated on 10/2022 and used as my own reference for simple trading models that already exist. The GitHub repository was created on 09/2024 for public use, yet not all models have been uploaded. The hub will be updated regularly (hopefully).

### Current Existing Models (in this repository):
1. Moving Average Crossover Strategy
2. Holts-Winter Time Series Forecasting
3. Mean Reversion Strategy

## Testings & Implementing:
All referencing models in this repository are coded in ipython. Idealy this should be run or either python, or even better C++.
The choice of Jupyter Notebook is simply for demonstrating purposes and readability.

For those who wish to run the code in python instead of ipython, please copy the code into a .py files first.
After that import the library "os" in order to read and extract your current working directory (or the Excel files directory) to read the .csv files.
Alternative way can be done manually by inputting the directory address into the code at the beginning.
Commencing the program shall be done via the terminal (cmd) by calling "python script_name.py".
If potential error appears please run in administrative mode, or check the executable of the .py file

### Cross Validations:
It is welcomed to use multiple strategy at the same time to generate insights for trading decisions. Some of my private strategies also adapts the same ideology.
